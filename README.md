#Crab-llvm#

Crab-llvm is a static analyzer that computes inductive invariants
based on [Crab](https://github.com/seahorn/crab) for LLVM-based
languages.

Crab-llvm provides two standalone tools: `llvmpp` and `crabllvm`:

- `llvmpp`: is a LLVM bytecode preprocessor that applies optimizations
to make easier the task of static analysis.

- `crabllvm`: converts LLVM bitcode into a language-independent CFG
  and computes invariants from it.

The use of `llvmpp` is optional but highly recommended with large
programs.

#Installation#

Crab-llvm is written in C++ and uses heavily the Boost library. You will need:

- C++ compiler supporting c++11
- Boost and Gmp

If you want Crab-llvm to reason about pointers and arrays you need to
download the following package at the root directory:

* [dsa-seahorn](https://github.com/seahorn/dsa-seahorn): ``` git clone https://github.com/seahorn/dsa-seahorn.git ```

Then, the compilation steps are:

1. ```mkdir build ; cd build```
2. ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=my_install_dir ../```

#Usage#

Crab-llvm provides a python script called `crabllvm.py` to interact
with users. Given a C program, users just need to type: `crabllvm.py
file.c --crab-answer`.

- The option `--crab-answer` displays all the invariants inferred for
each basic block in the `LLVM` bitcode.

- Users can also choose the abstract domain by typing the option
`--crab-domain`. The possible values are:

    - `int`: classical intervals
	- `ric`: reduced product of intervals and congruences
	- `zones`: difference-bound matrices
    - `term`: term equivalences (functor domain of uninterpreted functions
              parameterized with intervals)

- We also provide the option `--crab-track-lvl` to indicate the level
of precision. The possible values are: 

    - `reg`: reasons about integer scalars (LLVM registers).
	- `ptr`: reasons about pointer addresses.	
    - `mem`: reasons about the contents of pointers and
arrays.

If the level is `mem` then Crab-llvm simply uses an array smashing
domain whose base domain is the one selected by option
`--crab-domain`.
